(** Parse a .ml file, extract all 'external ...' primitives,
    and print a list of all symbols required

    Uses compiler-libs, which has an unstable API that can change between
    compiler versions, so extract only the minimal information needed here.
    If this breaks with newer compiler versions then
    ocaml-migrate-parsetree could be used.
    Currently require a 4.08 AST minimum (although this could be relaxed with
    migrate-parsetree).

    [ocamlc -dparsetree foo.ml] can be used to see how the parsetree looks
    like.

(** [value_description _ vd] is invoked by the AST iterator for value
    descriptions, including primitives ('external ...').
